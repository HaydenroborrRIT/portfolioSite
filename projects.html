                Hey, I'm Hayden Orr, and I originally grew up in Northwest, but I've lived in Rochester for the last five years. I'm currently in Applied Computer Technology, but I'm hoping to eventually transfer into Software Engineering (with my focus on Computer Security) or Computer Security once I've completed all necessary math credits required. I'm a total InfoSec geek.

                Despite graduating from Art school, I've never worked or been in visual art/design classes, so I'm a complete amateur. But I'm very excited about this class, and I'm looking forward to improving my front-end skill sets. 
            </p>

                I used to work at NTID in their Theatre department, so RIT's already like a second home to me. I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be back here on campus and a chance to take classes here. Last week has been so fun, and I look forward to experiencing many more weeks like this for the next few years.
